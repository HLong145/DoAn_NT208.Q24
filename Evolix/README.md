# Run and deploy your AI Studio app

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

View your app in AI Studio: https://ai.studio/apps/20df60d1-1e90-4b15-ab1a-fa99c2f052d3

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

`npm run dev` starts both the Vite frontend and the local auth API on an available local port, then wires the frontend to that API automatically. This avoids the fetch failure when port 4001 is already occupied by another service.
